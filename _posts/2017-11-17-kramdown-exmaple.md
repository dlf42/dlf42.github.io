This para line starts at the first column. However,
      the following lines can be indented any number of spaces/tabs.
   The para continues here.

  This is another paragraph, not connected to the above one. But  
with a hard line break. \\
And another one.

* This is the first line. Since the first non-space characters appears in
  column 3, all other indented lines have to be indented 2 spaces.
However, one could be lazy and not indent a line but this is not
recommended.
*       This is the another item of the list. It uses a different number
   of spaces for indentation which is okay but should generally be avoided.
   * The list item marker is indented 3 spaces which is allowed but should
     also be avoided and starts the third list item. Note that the lazy
     line in the second list item may make you believe that this is a
     sub-list which it isn't! So avoid being lazy!

*   Using a tab to indent this line, the tab only counts as three spaces
    and therefore the overall indentation is four spaces.

   1.   The tab after the marker counts here as three spaces. Since the
        indentation of the marker is three spaces and the marker itself
        takes two characters, the overall indentation needed for the
        following lines is eight spaces or two tabs.

definition term 1
definition term 2
: This is the first line. Since the first non-space characters appears in
column 3, all other lines have to be indented 2 spaces (or lazy syntax may
  be used after an indented line). This tells kramdown that the lines
  belong to the definition.
:       This is the another definition for the same term. It uses a
        different number of spaces for indentation which is okay but
        should generally be avoided.
   : The definition marker is indented 3 spaces which is allowed but
     should also be avoided.

definition term
: This definition will just be text because it would normally be a
  paragraph and the there is no preceding blank line.

  > although the definition contains other block-level elements

: This definition *will* be a paragraph since it is preceded by a
  blank line.
